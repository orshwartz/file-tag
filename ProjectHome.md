File tagging system for organizing and tagging files. Enables search, etc...

Uses Apache Derby as DB and Jetty web server for web UI.

This project was submitted on October 3rd, 2010. Not all requirements were met (e.g. there's no progress bar for initialization process - not on web-UI and not on GUI). Still, we got a grade 100 somehow. Great.
